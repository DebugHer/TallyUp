### Description
This mobile application will be a simple tool to create polls to settle anything you can think of. One example would be a group of employees or friends deciding on where to eat for lunch. Somebody would create a room that expires after a set amount of time, and shares a code/link with the others. They all vote on locations to eat and maybe even get access to navigate to the winner on Google Maps. That is one example, but there are a multitude of other use-cases that may get special features. 

There will be no user account creation whatsoever, as the application is too simple for that. The app will use anonymous users in a Firebase database to handle things in the background, but none of that will be known by users. A user will create a “room” that has a code associated. This code can be shared with others to enter their choices. This could be handled with Google’s deep-linking, in which the user shares a generated URL that will be opened in the app when others click on it, saving the amount of work to vote.

This project could eventually branch out into an iOS application and a web app as well. That will not be a focus of this semester, but using Firebase is easy enough on all three platforms that it could easily be cross-platform.
